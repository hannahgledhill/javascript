/**
 * 'mutating' a variable means reassigning its value
 * when declaring a const it has to have a value in the initial declaration.... .duh!
 * 
 * let is much better than var!!!!
 * 
 * can create properties on the global object by not using a define keyword
 * 
 * so just writing lastName = 'Schedtmann';
 * 
 * this doesn't create a variable with scope, it adds it to the global object (will find out later)
 * 
 * can define 2 variables at the same time:
 * let x, y;
 * 
 * these are both undefined currently;
 * 
 * x = y = 5;
 * this is setting both variables equal to 5
