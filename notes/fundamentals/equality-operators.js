/**
 * 
 * equality operators return a boolean value
 * 
 * === strict equality operators - values have to be equal AND the same type
 * == loose equality operators - implicit type coercion, so 2 == '2' would be true
 * 
 * strict operator is much better, the loose one has loads of weird rules and things that can cause bugs
 * 
 * !== strict different operator - this is better!!
 * != loose different operator
