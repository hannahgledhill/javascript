/**
 * 
 * ES6/ES2015 (same thing) was the biggest, most important update to javascript language
 * now has moved to annual cycle of small updates
 * 
 * BACKWARDS compatability - modern browsers will still run old javascript so no websites suddenly break
 * NOT FORWARDS compatible - older browsers won't be able to run newer code, so good to use Babel for production to transpile and polyfill code (converting back to ES5 to ensure browser compatibility)
 * 
 * ES5 is fully supported in all browsers today
 * ES6+ are well supported in MOST browsers, but some users might not have updated their browsers (though many do update automatically now)
 * 
 * ESNext is an umbrella term for all future releases
