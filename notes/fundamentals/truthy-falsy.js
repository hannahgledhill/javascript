/**
 * 
 * falsy values aren't yet false (except false) but become false when converted into a boolean
 * 0
 * ''
 * {}
 * undefined
 * null
 * NaN
 * false
 * 
 * NOT '0' or []
 * 
 * can check using Boolean()
 * NOTE javascript always does implicit type coercion to Boolean inside logic operators such as if(), while() etc.
 * 
 * really good to check if a variable is defined
 * 
 * let height;
 * if (height)
 * 
 * the type of height is undefined because it hasn't been assigned yet
 * remember, undefined and empty string are not the same as NULL, even though they all evaluate as false
