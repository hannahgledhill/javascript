/**
 * 
 * an expression is a piece of code that produces a value eg. 3 + 4 or even just the number 1994, true, false etc.
 * 
 * a statement is a bigger piece of code that is executed and does not produce a value
 * eg. if (23 > 10) const str = '23 is bigger'; --> the whole statement does not product a single value, it just executes stuff
 * 
 * NOTE in a template literal you can ONLY use expressions, not statements! so can't do if() etc. inside a template literal
