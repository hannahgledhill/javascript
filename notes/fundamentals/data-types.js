/**
 * Number (floating point) -- decimals and integers, this is why we parseInt or parseFloat
 * Strings - sequence of characters in quotes
 * Boolean - either true or false
 * Undefined - value assigned to a variable that has no value. the variable exists but it doesn't contain anything
 * Null - 'empty' value but is actually a value
 * Symbol - a unique value that cannot be changed
 * BigInt - super large nubmers that are too big for Number
 * 
 * In javascript the VALUE has a type, not the variable. Can replace a variable containing a string with a number of whatever, though this can cause some problems
 * 
 * can use typeof [variable] to find the variable's type
 * 
 * can do typeof var to check if it is 'undefined';
 * null has typeof object
 * 
 * template literals allow for multiline strings
